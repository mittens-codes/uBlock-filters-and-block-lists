# uBlock-filters-and-block-lists
What it says on the package. Mostly curated for my personal use only, but if you find them useful feel free to use them or to adapt.

I highly recommend dipping your toes into the following repos BEFORE YOU TOUCH THIS ONE! Seriously.
1) https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt
2) https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/4.1-Extensions
I also recommend reading the uBlock Origin documentation.

## Compatibility
This code has been written for uBlock Origin and uBlock Origin only. You may of course try it with any other adblocking software you like, but it is not designed for that and likely will not work.
